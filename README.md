# Newton

**⚠️ Prerelease Software ⚠️**

**This project is in active alpha development.** This means the API is unstable, features may be added or removed, and
breaking changes are likely to occur frequently and without notice as the design is refined.

Newton is a GPU-accelerated physics simulation engine built upon [NVIDIA Warp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp),
specifically targeting roboticists and simulation researchers.
It extends and generalizes Warp's existing `warp.sim` module, integrating
[MuJoCo Warp](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_warp) as a primary backend.
Newton emphasizes GPU-based computation, differentiability, and user-defined extensibility, facilitating rapid iteration
and scalable robotics simulation.

Newton is maintained by [Disney Research](https://www.disneyresearch.com/), [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/),
and [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/).

## Development

See the [development guide](https://newton-physics.github.io/newton/development-guide.html) for instructions on how to
get started.
